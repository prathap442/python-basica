# the `in` key word here basically returns the datatype of the boolean as the return value for the iterable datatypes
# the iterable datatypes would be the strings and the lists

'''
  We need to know the difference between `del` and the `remove` keywords
  see .append how can we use for arrays to add the elements in the array

  List Methods:
  - usage of + operator for adding the lists
  - [1,2,3] + list(3,2)
  - append method for adding but need to concentrate on the return datatype for the append
  - project: on taking the names from the people and appending if they wish and removing if they already exist

  
  Tuples:
  - what are tuples?
  - when will they be usable?
  - what is the comparision that can be done from the list to the tuples?
