# How to run test cases for unittesting
  in python we run it by using the command
  ```
    python3 -m unittest circle_test.py
  ```

  if we suppose add these lines like
  ```
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
  ```

  then the unit test would be ran by simply
  ```
    python3 circle_test.py
  ```
